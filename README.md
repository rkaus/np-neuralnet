# np-neuralnet
3 layer neural network class with gradient descent backpropogation written only in numpy. Environmental and seasonal features used to predict bike share rental ridership in Washington, D.C.

## Data Set
Aggregated bike sharing rental and corresponding weather/seasonal information from http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data and http://www.freemeteo.com. Compiled by University of Porto, Portugal and distributed by Udacity.

## Use
The NeuralNetwork class in nn.py has 5 user defined variables.
	1. input_odes: the number of features that you wish to train on
	2. hidden_nodes: the number of hidden nodes in the hidden layer
	3. output_nodes: the number of output nodes
	4. learning_rate: scaling for backpropogated weights (adaptability to new data)
	5. iterations: number of iterations

To try it, make sure requirements.txt are met.
Then, run eda.py and Bike-Sharing-Dataset.
